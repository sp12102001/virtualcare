			<h4>How to use this site</h4>
			<p>This tool shows you the questions that will need to be answered to implement and maintain a sustainable Virtual Care System. You probably won't be able to answer all the questions by yourself, so identify the people that have the knwodlege and skills on the different areas covered by this tool and ask them the questions. They might be people in other departments or even some of the suppliers used by your organisation.</p>
			<p>Beside the questions you will sometimes see an icon. Clicking on them will provide extra information. Below is a brief explanation of what each icon means:</p>
<p><img class="icon" src="media/why.png" alt="Why should you ask this question" style="height:48px;"><b>Why should you ask this question?</b></p><br>

						<span class="popuptext" id="newVCS-pop2">Having someone within an organisation with sustainability as their core agenda is important so they can champion decisions based on reducing environmental impacts. They can also ensure that sustainability goals and initiatives align with the organisation's overall strategic objectives and help integrate sustainability considerations into business strategy, operations, and decision-making processes. Depending on your role, the following questions may be applicable directly to you, or they may need to be posed to senior colleagues:
<ul style="text-align: left;"> <li>Has your organisation appointed somebody to champion sustainability issues?</li>
<li>Does the sustainability expert have digital expertise? If not, has someone in the digital technology team been identified to be responsible for this contribution to sustainability?</li></ul>

<ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Will the individuals and teams deploying and supporting the virtual care system be sufficiently trained from a sustainability perspective? Will they be provided with training materials and workshops that are maintained over time to reflect new policies and practices arising?</li>
<li>Will these individuals and teams be incentivised to make progress toward the goals outlined in their training, including time for sustainability activities, recognition for completion, and so on?</li></ul>
