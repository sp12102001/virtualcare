		<h4><a id="data_suf"></a>Data sufficiency</h4>
		<p>Data sufficiency means only collecting and processing data sufficient for the outcome you need to achieve. It is a crucial consideration in minimising the environmental impacts of data, and in the healthcare context it can have the added benefit of reducing data overload for healthcare professionals.</p>

	  <h4><a id="rebound_effects">Rebound Effects</a></h4>
	  <p>Rebound effects are linked with increased efficiency in processes or technologies. When you make changes to increase efficiency to reduce the use of resources (such as energy, amount of compute, time), there is a risk that your new proposition will estimulate an increase in demand and instead of having savings on resources, you end up with the same or increased consumption. So a "successful" strategy that increases efficiency in energy consumption to reduce carbon emissions, migh in fact generate more carbon emissions.</p>
		<p>This example should help illustrate rebound effects in digital services: Data centres use large amount of energy to power its servers producing a large amount of carbon emissions. To make it more environmentally sustainable, the management of the data centre decides to substitute the provision of energy from fossil fuels to renewable energy. That decision could lead to some possible rebound effects:
<ul><li>The perception that swapping to renewable energy cause fewer carbon emissions makes users feel they don't need to limit their use, which in turn leads to an overall increase in the use of the data centre.</li>
	<li>The change to renewables attracts new business customers in addition to the existing ones.</li>
	<li>Extra revenue enables data centre owner to invest it in a new building and equipment for a data centre expansion.</li>
	<li>New business customers increase their provision of digital services stimulating the demand for more data centres and the economy in general.</li>
		</ul>
To deal with potential rebound effects, the data centre management could consider mitigation strategies alongside their proposed changes:
<ul><li>Provide transparent information and communication to raise awareness showing that renewable energy also has a carbon footprint.</li>
<li>Data centre owner could invests extra revenue to improve environmental sustainability performance of existing facilities or donate to sustainability charities, instead of investing in business growth.</li>
<li>Data centre could adopt new management procedures to reduce idle servers, for example, sharing racks amongst different business customers to delay or prevent the need to increase capacity.</li></ul>
